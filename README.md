Chaturbate
===========

This is a plugin that creates a new channel in Plex Media Server (PMS) to view content from [chaturbate.com](https://chaturbate.com/). It is currently under development and as such, should be considered alpha software and potentially unstable.  For now this is a very simple version of what it could be.  It returns basic information but the video thumbs don't update like they do on the site.

**Note:** The author of this plugin has no affiliation with [chaturbate.com](https://chaturbate.com/) site or the owners of the content that they host.
